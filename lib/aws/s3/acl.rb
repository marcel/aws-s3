  module S3
    # By default buckets are private. This means that only the owner has access rights to the bucket and its objects. 
    # Objects in that bucket inherit the permission of the bucket unless otherwise specified. When an object is private, the owner can 
    # generate a signed url that exposes the object to anyone who has that url. Alternatively, buckets and objects can be given other 
    # access levels. Several canned access levels are defined:
    # 
    # * <tt>:private</tt> - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. No one else has any access rights. This is the default.
    # * <tt>:public_read</tt> - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL and the anonymous principal is granted READ access. If this policy is used on an object, it can be read from a browser with no authentication.
    # * <tt>:public_read_write</tt> - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL, the anonymous principal is granted READ and WRITE access. This is a useful policy to apply to a bucket, if you intend for any anonymous user to PUT objects into the bucket.
    # * <tt>:authenticated_read</tt> - Owner gets FULL_CONTROL, and any principal authenticated as a registered Amazon S3 user is granted READ access.
    # 
    # You can set a canned access level when you create a bucket or an object by using the <tt>:access</tt> option:
    # 
    #   S3Object.store(
    #     'kiss.jpg', 
    #     data, 
    #     'marcel', 
    #     :access => :public_read
    #   )
    # 
    # Since the image we created is publicly readable, we can access it directly from a browser by going to the corresponding bucket name 
    # and specifying the object's key without a special authenticated url:
    # 
    #  http://s3.amazonaws.com/marcel/kiss.jpg
    # 
    # ==== Building custum access policies
    # 
    # For both buckets and objects, you can use the <tt>acl</tt> method to see its access control policy:
    # 
    #   policy = S3Object.acl('kiss.jpg', 'marcel')
    #   pp policy.grants
    #   [#<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant FULL_CONTROL to noradio>,
    #    #<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant READ to AllUsers Group>]
    # 
    # Policies are made up of one or more grants which grant a specific permission to some grantee. Here we see the default FULL_CONTROL grant 
    # to the owner of this object. There is also READ permission granted to the Allusers Group, which means anyone has read access for the object.
    # 
    # Say we wanted to grant access to anyone to read the access policy of this object. The current READ permission only grants them permission to read 
    # the object itself (for example, from a browser) but it does not allow them to read the access policy. For that we will need to grant the AllUsers group the READ_ACP permission.
    # 
    # First we'll create a new grant object:
    # 
    #   grant = ACL::Grant.new
    #   # => #<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant (permission) to (grantee)>
    #   grant.permission = 'READ_ACP'
    # 
    # Now we need to indicate who this grant is for. In other words, who the grantee is:
    # 
    #   grantee = ACL::Grantee.new
    #   # => #<AWS::S3::ACL::Grantee (xsi not set yet)>
    # 
    # There are three ways to specify a grantee: 1) by their internal amazon id, such as the one returned with an object's Owner, 
    # 2) by their Amazon account email address or 3) by specifying a group. As of this writing you can not create custom groups, but 
    # Amazon does provide three already: AllUsers, Authenticated and LogDelivery. In this case we want to provide the grant to all users. 
    # This effectively means "anyone".
    # 
    #   grantee.group = 'AllUsers'
    # 
    # Now that our grantee is setup, we'll associate it with the grant:
    # 
    #   grant.grantee = grantee
    #   grant
    #   # => #<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant READ_ACP to AllUsers Group>
    # 
    # Are grant has all the information we need. Now that it's ready, we'll add it on to the object's access control policy's list of grants:
    # 
    #   policy.grants << grant
    #   pp policy.grants
    #   [#<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant FULL_CONTROL to noradio>,
    #    #<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant READ to AllUsers Group>,
    #    #<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant READ_ACP to AllUsers Group>]
    # 
    # Now that the policy has the new grant, we reuse the <tt>acl</tt> method to persist the policy change:
    # 
    #   S3Object.acl('kiss.jpg', 'marcel', policy)
    # 
    # If we fetch the object's policy again, we see that the grant has been added:
    # 
    #   pp S3Object.acl('kiss.jpg', 'marcel').grants
    #   [#<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant FULL_CONTROL to noradio>,
    #    #<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant READ to AllUsers Group>,
    #    #<AWS::S3::ACL::Grant READ_ACP to AllUsers Group>]
    # 
    # If we were to access this object's acl url from a browser: 
    # 
    #   http://s3.amazonaws.com/marcel/kiss.jpg?acl
    # 
    # we would be shown its access control policy.
    # 
    # ==== Pre-prepared grants
    # 
    # Alternatively, the ACL::Grant class defines a set of stock grant policies that you can fetch by name. In most cases, you can 
    # just use one of these pre-prepared grants rather than building grants by hand. Two of these stock policies are <tt>:public_read</tt> 
    # and <tt>:public_read_acp</tt>, which happen to be the two grants that we built by hand above. In this case we could have simply written:
    # 
    #   policy.grants << ACL::Grant.grant(:public_read)
    #   policy.grants << ACL::Grant.grant(:public_read_acp)
    #   S3Object.acl('kiss.jpg', 'marcel', policy)
    # 
    # The full details can be found in ACL::Policy, ACL::Grant and ACL::Grantee.
    module ACL
      # The ACL::Policy class lets you inspect and modify access controls for buckets and objects.
      # A policy is made up of one or more Grants which specify a permission and a Grantee to whom that permission is granted.
      #
      # Buckets and objects are given a default access policy which contains one grant permitting the owner of the bucket or object
      # FULL_CONTROL over its contents. This means they can read the object, write to the object, as well as read and write its
      # policy.
      #
      # The <tt>acl</tt> method for both buckets and objects returns the policy object for that entity:
      #
      #   policy = Bucket.acl('some-bucket')
      #
      # The <tt>grants</tt> method of a policy exposes its grants. You can treat this collection as an array and push new grants onto it:
      #
      #   policy.grants << grant
      #
      # Check the documentation for Grant and Grantee for more details on how to create new grants.
